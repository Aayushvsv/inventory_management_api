Inventory Management API ðŸ“¦
A robust and high-performance RESTful API for managing product inventory, built with Python and FastAPI. This project demonstrates best practices in modern backend development, including asynchronous programming, database integration, data validation, and automated testing.

Key Features
Full CRUD Functionality: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for products.

Asynchronous: Built on FastAPI for high-performance, non-blocking I/O.

Data Validation: Uses Pydantic for robust request and response data validation.

Database Integration: Uses SQLAlchemy ORM for seamless interaction with a relational database (PostgreSQL in production, SQLite for local development).

Automated Testing: Includes a suite of unit tests written with Pytest to ensure reliability.

Dependency Injection: Leverages FastAPI's dependency injection system for managing database sessions.

Deployment Ready: Configured to be deployed on cloud platforms like Render using environment variables.
